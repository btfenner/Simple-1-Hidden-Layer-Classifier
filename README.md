# Simple-1-Hidden-Layer-Classifier
This a simple MatLab code that will taken a n inputs and m data sets. nxm and a mx1 class matrix.
fenner_MLP_BP_train1.mat is a function in matlab that returns the hidden layer weights, W1, and output layer weights, W2. epoch is the number of cycles the users wants. L is the number of output units. for a three classifier L=3. J is the number of hidden layer units. ro is the output learning rate and rh is the hidden layer learning rate. each unit goes through the tangent hyperbolic function.
